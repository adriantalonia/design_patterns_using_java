## Design Patterns in Java
A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.

Now, a question will be arising in your mind what kind of specific problem? Let me explain by taking an example.

**Problem Given**:
Suppose you want to create a class for which only a single instance (or object) should be created and that single object can be used by all other classes.

**Solution**:
Singleton design pattern is the best solution of above specific problem. So, every design pattern has some specification or set of rules for solving the problems. What are those specifications, you will see later in the types of design patterns.
