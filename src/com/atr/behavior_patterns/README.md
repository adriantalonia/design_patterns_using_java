## Behavioral Design Patterns

> Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.

In these design patterns, the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.

That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.

### There are 12 types of behavioral design patterns:
1) Chain of Responsibility Pattern
2) Command Pattern
3) Interpreter Pattern
4) Iterator Pattern
5) Mediator Pattern
6) Memento Pattern
7) Observer Pattern
8) State Pattern
9) Strategy Pattern
10) Template Pattern
11) Visitor Pattern
12) Null Object
