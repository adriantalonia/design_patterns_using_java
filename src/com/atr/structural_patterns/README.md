## Structural design patterns

Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.

The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.

These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.



### Types of structural design patterns
**There are following 7 types of structural design patterns.**

1) **Adapter Patter**
>Adapting an interface into another according to client expectation.

2) **Bridge Pattern**
>Separating abstraction (interface) from implementation.

3) **Composite Pattern**
>Allowing clients to operate on hierarchy of objects.

4) **Decorator Pattern**
>Adding functionality to an object dynamically.

5) **Facade Pattern**
>Providing an interface to a set of interfaces.

6) **Flyweight Pattern**
>Reusing an object by sharing it.

7) **Proxy Pattern**
>Representing another object.
