## Lazy initialization approach

Lazy initialization: In this method, object is created only if it is needed. This may prevent resource wastage. An implementation of getInstance() method is required which return the instance. There is a null check that if object is not created then create, otherwise return previously created. To make sure that class cannot be instantiated in any other way, constructor is made final. As object is created with in a method, it ensures that object will not be created until and unless it is required. Instance is kept private so that no one can access it directly.
It can be used in a single threaded environment because multiple threads can break singleton property because they can access get instance method simultaneously and create multiple objects. 

1) Object is created only if it is needed. It may overcome resource overcome and wastage of CPU time.
2) Exception handling is also possible in method.
3) Every time a condition of null has to be checked.
4) instance canâ€™t be accessed directly.
5) In multithreaded environment, it may break singleton property.

```java
//Java Code to create singleton class
// With Lazy initialization
public class GFG
{
  // private instance, so that it can be
  // accessed by only by getInstance() method
  private static GFG instance;
 
  private GFG()
  {
    // private constructor
  }
 
  //method to return instance of class
  public static GFG getInstance()
  {
    if (instance == null)
    {
      // if instance is null, initialize
      instance = new GFG();
    }
    return instance;
  }
}
```
